# Image_Classification_with_Neural_Networks

### Project Summary

In this project, I created a multioutput classification CNN that accurately predicts North American herbivore species. 

The species are the following:

- Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep 
- Moose
- Pronghorn
- American Bison
- Mule Deer
- White-tailed Deer
- Rocky Mountain Elk

These animals reside in the same region of the Western United States and Southwestern Canada. A model like this can be deployed and be useful to a tourist in the many national parks in the West or anyone who is curious about and wants to properly identify wildlife.

The project will require the following steps:

Get images from Google of each of the species.
Pre-process the images for model building, specifically neural networks.
Build a Convolutional Neural Network.
Fine tune the models.
Deploy the best model - (possible deployments could be an iOS/Android app, etc.)

This project can be recreated by simply using the Jupyter notebook, no need to download any images. Be sure to install the correct Python packages shown in the notebook.
