# Image_Classification_with_Neural_Networks

In this project, I created a multioutput classification CNN that accurately predicts North American herbivore species. For an in-depth explanation of the project, steps taken and takeaways please see the Jupyter notebook. 

This project can be recreated by simply using the Jupyter notebook. Just make sure you install the correct Python packages and change the paths that I used in the functions.
